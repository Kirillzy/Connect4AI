# Connect4AI
 This is a project I made that has an AI you can play against, as well as a graphical interface.

The purpose of this project is to show what I have learned bundled up into one project

This time it is a connect 4 game, where I built the board, a player vs player function, and even an AI function, as well as a graphical interface using the Tkinter module.
